Hi, my name is Jason Biatek (pronounced "bee attic", [he/him](https://pronouns.org/he-him)). I'm a software engineer at [Itemis, Inc.](https://www.itemis.com) with specialties in programming languages, domain-specific languages, software testing, formal methods, and safety-critical systems. I have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-biatek/) profile if you'd like to connect.

# Projects

My current main work is on [Itemis SECURE](https://www.itemis.com/en/products/itemis-secure/), a tool for conducting threat and risk assessments with specialties for ISO 21434 using [JetBrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/). 

Previously, I worked on a language at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en) called CLEAR, with an associated tool Text2Test. CLEAR is a domain-specific language for writing software requirements. It reads like English, but is actually a formal grammar with defined semantics. Text2Test reads CLEAR and can do analysis on requirements for consistency and completeness as well as generate test cases.

In graduate school, I worked on a project based around [PLEXIL](https://plexil-group.github.io/plexil_docs/), a planning and execution language developed at NASA. My work was on a tool called [TPlex](https://github.com/jbiatek/TPlex), which translated PLEXIL plans into Java or Lustre for test case generation using Java PathFinder or JKind.

I also worked on a research project in my undergraduate career at the [University of Minnesota Morris](https://morris.umn.edu/) called DigiQuilt. DigiQuilt is graphical software for teaching elementary school students fractions and symmetry through designing quilt patterns out of geometric shapes, with an emphasis on feeling tactile and requiring some spatial reasoning to manipulate pieces. Our research was on the impact of a shared large display in the classroom as students worked individually on their own machines.

In less serious work, I also have a series of very silly websites based on games played on one of my favorite podcasts, [Connected](https://www.relay.fm/connected) from Relay FM: [Rickipedia](https://rickies.net), [Quizzipedia](https://quizzies.net), and, from an alternate universe, [Pickipedia](https://pickipedia.net). These are all built in [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com), which is a really cool and weird bit of software, much much more than just a wiki if you dig down into it.
